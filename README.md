### Hi there ü•ê

<!--
**nonepork/nonepork** is a ‚ú® _special_ ‚ú® repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on ...
- üå± I‚Äôm currently learning ...
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on ...
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with ...
- üí¨ Ask me about ...
- üì´ How to reach me: ...
- üòÑ Pronouns: ...
- ‚ö° Fun fact: ...
-->

I don't really like those introductions( totally not jealous ),
so browse my repositories, and let my result speak for itself.
